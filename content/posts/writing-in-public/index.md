### Atomic habits

5 years ago during the COVID lockdowns I began running. I had never been a fitness guru but with little else to do, it made sense to disconnect from the noise and begin a healthy new habit. Exercise was always something I knew I should do, but I never carved out the time to make it a part of my routine. Even 5 years later, routines can lapse, but I always feel better after each session. Even if that session wasn't my best pace or distance. It is about showing up and proving that I can do it.

It might sound like a rogue place to start, but there are lots of parallels with blogging. I have always admired creators in the Tech space who manage to hold down full-time jobs whilst also putting their experience out there for others to learn from - all for free.

### Motivations

In starting this blog, my motiviations are as follows:

1. **Fighting imposter syndrome / perfectionism** - The tech space is impossibly broad. You need to be comfortable that you will never learn everything. Even as a Senior Engineer I get bouts of imposter syndrome. For that reason, I will never be "ready" to write a blog as I will never feel like the expert. But that's not the point. Putting _something_ out there might spark a conversation which I never would have had otherwise.
1. **Proving a point** - In an age of Artificial Intelligence (AI), content is being produced at a rapid pace, and the craft of writing is one of the key skills I want to remain sharp. Original human thought is what trained a lot of these Large Language Models (LLMs) in the first place.    
1. **Learning** - In writing about what I know, I will be forced to research topics and engage with people who know a lot more than me. What's not to love about that?

### What can you expect? 
Ramblings on various tech industry and career topics, such as:
- Language design/features
- Public cloud
- Recent announcements or events
- Career ladders

I will aim to hold myself accountable to post every ~2 weeks each year.
