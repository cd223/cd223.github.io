Welcome to the first "book club" session. This week, we take a brief step into the world of GenAI Agents, having read "_[Principles of Building AI Agents](https://mastra.ai/book)_" by [Sam Bhagwat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sambhagwat/). üìö 

> _This post risks being outdated not long after it is published, as is the speed of iteration in this area of technology._ 

### My Two Cents ü™ô
Like most waves of change and hype in the tech industry, the GenAI topic understandably causes divisiveness and scepticism. A lot of this reaction is justified. 
Not long ago, we had a hype cycle around Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, which did not cause the revolution it promised. Blockchain often felt like a solution in search of a problem. GenAI has an explosion of tangible use cases, but needs to answer critical questions in several areas before it can allay concerns. 
To name a few: the social, environmental and security impact of adopting this technology at scale.  

We could place a lot of these hype cycles along different points of the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle). 
Blockchain and Cryptocurrency has found its niche. GenAI could follow a similar path once the dust settles. 

To avoid bloat, this post purely focuses on the **engineering discipline and terminology** that the book introduces, not the impact of this technology and its adoption, or my use of these tools for productivity. I will save that for a future post. 
Criticism, if justified, needs to come from a place of education.

### The Book üìñ
I learned about this book from a [Tweet](https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1926342778012786853) ("X"?) by [Gergely Orosz](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/). Out of curiosity, I downloaded the e-book and Sam reached out to send across a physical copy. 

It is a short read (1-2 hours) for technical readers that introduces _a lot of breadcrumbs_ for people to go away and read more on. This means that by the end, you are not an expert, but carry a lot of the terms you need to become one. _I am not being sponsored to write this_ - I just think it is great organic marketing and enjoy shorter reads.

[Mastra](https://mastra.ai/) is a company building a TypeScript framework for building AI Agents. Sam is a co-founder of the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs) web framework, and is taking a bet on how people will define agentic workflows.

The book is available in [virtual](https://mastra.ai/book) or [physical](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Building-Agents-Sam-Bhagwat/dp/B0DYH5GHDD/ref=sr_1_1) form.
