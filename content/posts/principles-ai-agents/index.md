### My Two Cents 🪙
- My background (new to AI, mostly experienced, keen to learn)
- AI impact / hype / VC funding
- Legal trifecta
- Environmental / cost impact
- Effect on jobs / economy 
- Less "if you can't beat them, join them", more "it is clear that this technology wave is here to stay - learn the principles".
- This post focuses on the engineering discipline, not the above (which may be a new post)

### The Book 📖
