A common adage for any developer choosing a database technology is _"just use Postgres"_. While this advice remains well-intentioned, it deserves a fresh look in 2025. Thanks to a wave of recent innovations and acquisitions, PostgreSQL providers now resemble JavaScript frameworks of the 2010s - there‚Äôs seemingly a new one to consider every six months.

Just choosing PostgreSQL isn‚Äôt enough anymore - there is an _entirely new decision tree_ to follow before you can launch a system. üå≥

**TL;DR**: The answer to _"Which one do I choose?"_ is always _"It depends"_, but this post signposts exactly what those deciding factors are. ‚öñÔ∏è

### Postgres Renaissance üé®
The saying [_"just use Postgres"_](https://mccue.dev/pages/8-16-24-just-use-postgres) is deliberately simplistic. It is intended to reduce analysis paralysis at a critical point in a system's lifetime. Postgres is the "boring" choice because it has been battle-tested in production for decades by thousands of companies. Being [open-source](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) and [extensible](https://medium.com/agedb/introduction-to-postgresql-extensions-770e37f3fae1), it has a [thriving community](https://www.postgresql.org/community/). There is very little to gain by choosing a less-proven technology. Or one with restrictive licensing. Or adopting several solutions with their own cost models. It closes the fewest number of doors when a project's uncertainty is at its highest. 

Recent Postgres versions and extensions (e.g [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)) have introduced and significantly improved support for vector/JSON data, which makes it even harder to justify starting with a specialised store. Extensions like [`pg_duckdb`](https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb) support column-oriented, analytical workloads inside a row-oriented, transactional system. [Many](https://www.tigerdata.com/blog/how-to-collapse-your-stack-using-postgresql-for-everything) [articles](https://dev.to/shayy/postgres-is-too-good-and-why-thats-actually-a-problem-4imc) exist on the versatility of Postgres. Some even go as far as stating you can host a full REST API with [PostgREST](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v13/) (though I haven't seen Production examples of this).

In recent times, database technologies derived from Postgres have exploded in number and seen rapid success. In the last few months alone:
- ü§ë [Databricks acquired Neon](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-agrees-acquire-neon-help-developers-deliver-ai-systems), a serverless Postgres provider.
- ü§ë [Snowflake acquired Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/crunchy-data-joins-snowflake), a hosted Postgres provider.
- üéâ [AWS Aurora DSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-dsql-is-now-generally-available/) was released.
- üéâ PlanetScale expanded on its MySQL foundation, to offer a [Postgres alternative](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-for-postgres).

Below is a _non-exhaustive_ list of recent technologies derived from Postgres, and their offerings.

{{< callout type="warning" title="Cautionary Tales ‚ö†Ô∏è" collapse="false" >}}
Choosing Postgres over other relational databases doesn't always go to plan. Uber famously [switched](https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/postgres-to-mysql-migration/) to MySQL after facing slowness during writes, favouring the way MySQL handles index updates. Other systems have [faced issues](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2023/04/the-part-of-postgresql-we-hate-the-most.html) such as table bloat and transaction ID wraparound due to Postgres‚Äôs MVCC model, which avoids locks in favor of versioning.
This is a good opportunity to preach the lessons from [_Data Intensive Applications_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/). Without understanding the underlying storage and retrieval technology these databases rely on, you are likely to face surprises in Production.

### Recent Trends üî®
In this section we go over the main innovations that have emerged in recent years, which have caused the explosion in providers, each with their own unique offerings. As Postgres is open-source, it is possible to cherry-pick features and compromise on some fundamental aspects in order to unlock new behaviours.

#### Compute <> Storage Divide ‚ûó
Postgres pre-dates the age of cloud and distributed systems. As such, it is monolithic (combining storage and compute on the same server) and process-oriented (rather than [thread-oriented](https://engineeringatscale.substack.com/p/will-postgresql-switch-to-a-thread)). To thrive in a cloud-native world, providers have [decoupled](https://thenewstack.io/new-oltp-postgres-with-separate-compute-and-storage/) storage and compute layers, which allows each layer to scale independently. This change enables [serverless](https://jack-vanlightly.com/analyses/2023/11/15/neon-serverless-postgresql-asds-chapter-3) systems like Neon and AWS Aurora Serverless. Use of durable block storage like S3 means lightweight VMs can run the Query Engine and hold minimal state, allowing horizontal scalability. Different systems embrace this to different extents. For example, Aurora Serverless v2 incurs a 15 second cold-start when [scaling up from zero](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/introducing-scaling-to-0-capacity-with-amazon-aurora-serverless-v2/).

Besides scalability, the other by-products of standalone storage are [database branching](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branching) and [fast backups](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-fast-database-cloning/) due to copy-on-write semantics. These are game-changing features that a traditional Postgres system cannot provide. 

#### Relaxing Isolation for Speed üèéÔ∏è
Postgres is flexible in supporting 4 levels of [transaction isolation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html) at session or transaction level. By constraining the isolation level to `Repeatable Read` (using something like Snapshot Isolation) rather than `Serializable`, we require far less consensus before transactions can commit or return data.     

In most applications, the key-set of data being read is far greater than the key-set of data being written, and reads outnumber writes by an order of magnitude. This realisation along with constraining isolation level to `Repeatable Read` is core to the [way AWS DSQL scales](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/12/17/occ-and-isolation.html). By constraining in one dimension, new technologies are unlocking scale that a traditional setup could not match.

#### New Data Primitives üìäÔ∏è
Being a general purpose and extensible database, some providers have imposed an opinionated abstraction on top of core Postgres. For example, TigerData introduces [`hypertables`](https://docs.tigerdata.com/use-timescale/latest/hypertables/) to model time-series data, which would otherwise need manual partitioning and regular pruning via extensions like [`pg_partman`](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) and [`pg_cron`](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron).  

AI companies make use of vector stores (through [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) and [HNSW indexes](https://medium.com/@wtaisen/hnsw-indexing-in-vector-databases-simple-explanation-and-code-3ef59d9c1920)) to build RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines. The recent Databricks and Snowflake acquisitions show that engineers increasingly value an "all-in-one" platform rather than a standalone OLAP solution.

### Decision Points ‚öñÔ∏è
This section raises a set of questions I would consider when evaluating a Postgres provider to reduce a lot of future pain points. They are not ordered by priority.

#### Query Patterns ‚ùì
- What is the expected ratio of reads and writes - is a single instance sufficient? _(Does the provider offer a range of instance sizes? Are there read replicas, connection poolers or sharding solutions?)_
- What periods of inactivity am I expecting? _(Serverless is more economically-viable for spiky workloads. In practice, when baseline traffic varies by at least 50% from its peak.)_
- What levels of transaction isolation will I need? _(This rules out a few distributed offerings.)_
- Does the provider have global endpoints / multi-region support? _(Local benchmarks are no good if your database is on the other side of the world)._

#### Compatibility üíò
- Do we need runtime compatibility, wire-protocol, or [something in between](https://www.yugabyte.com/postgresql/compare-postgresql-compatibility/)? _(How many Postgres features will I have support for?)._
- What service limitations exist? _(e.g., [Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraPostgreSQLReleaseNotes/AuroraPostgreSQL.Extensions.html) on database object counts, concurrent connections, foreign keys, transaction size or timings)._
- What extensions are available? _(e.g., Cloud platforms often expose only a [subset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraPostgreSQLReleaseNotes/AuroraPostgreSQL.Extensions.html))._
- Are system tables accessible, or can I easily monitor diagnostic information? _(e.g., `pg_stat-*` tables)._ 
- What integrations exist with existing services? _(e.g., Cloud providers offer archival or "zero-ETL" features)._

#### Control üí™
- Does a `superuser` exist? _(Some platforms [do not provide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.html) access)._
- How portable is my data? _(Can the underlying backups and data files be exported externally?)._
- How much control do we need over major versions' adoption timelines? _(Vendors often enforce a [support window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/extended-support.html))._
- What methods are supported for upgrades? _(e.g., In-place, logical replication, zero-downtime. Providers like YugabyteDB claim to have zero-downtime upgrades. Others need [DIY solutions](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/pg_upgrade))._
- What is the pricing model? _(Is billing broken down by storage, compute and I/O?)._ 

#### Security & Risk üé≤
- How much trust do you place in the company in the long term? _(Cloud providers may sunset services but have better longevity. Newer providers may withdraw their free tier, or be acquired and change pricing)._  
- What [encryption](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/data-encryption-in-postgres-a-guidebook) and security models exist? _(Is my infrastructure pooled or isolated? Can I rotate encryption keys used?)._
- Is there support for multi-tenancy or Row-Level Security (RLS)? _([Nile](https://www.thenile.dev/) aims to address this for B2B SaaS firms)._
- What SLAs exist and is downtime compensated? _(e.g., During scaling events / maintenance windows)._

### Starting Point üìç
Having raised the important questions, it is clear that there is a lot to think about upfront. In the absence of any other information (and to avoid being overwhelmed!), I would adopt these principles.

1. **Stay close to the roots ü™æ**: Maintain runtime compatibility with standard PosrgreSQL for as long as possible. This makes local testing and feedback loops much quicker, and means faster adoption of new versions.
1. **Benchmark üìê**: Measure against your own workloads - do not rely solely on online benchmarks.
1. **Avoid sprawl üêô**: Default to Postgres for new use cases before reaching for new platforms or databases.
2. **Know your options üß†**: Periodically evaluate which migration paths exist, their upgrade timelines, tenancy models and trends.

Once a solution is adopted at scale, migration to a new setup is always possible, but it takes significant effort (just ask [Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-databases-team-lived-to-tell-the-scale/)). There is no way to know the future, but with these principles in mind you will do better than most at adopting the right flavour of Postgres for your use case.

### Summary üßµ
In this post, we revisited the advice to _"just use Postgres"_ refreshed for 2025, in the broader context of acquisitions and recent product launches. The statement still holds true, but some nuance exists to answer the question of _"what next?"_. These questions form a practical checklist for evaluating Postgres providers.

It is an exciting time to be a developer working with Postgres, as the technology continues to evolve almost 40 years after its [inception at Berkeley](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.0/intro60.htm). 

In future posts, I may dive into some of the [idiosyncrasies](https://www.avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme) of Postgres or dive into systems like AWS' DSQL.  There are some great creators in the space which make it far easier to keep up to date in the meantime. For example:

- üéß [Scaling Postgres](https://www.scalingpostgres.com/)
- üéß [Talking Postgres](https://talkingpostgres.com/)
