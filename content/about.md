## Hello, world! 👋

I’m a Senior Engineer based in London with over 7 years’ experience in FinTech and Financial Services. I mainly focus on backend development, having led Product and Platform teams on a range of projects.

On my [Blog](../posts/), I share:  
- Thoughts on backend development & industry trends  
- Shout-outs to content I’m enjoying (reading, watching, listening)  
- War stories and incidents — from projects I’ve worked on or public ones  

I try to keep things short and engaging. If something resonates, I’d love to start a conversation!

## Note to recruiters / agencies 🤝

I’m happy where I am right now and not actively looking. But if you have something interesting, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-j-davies/). I don’t make my CV public, but happy to share it privately if needed.
