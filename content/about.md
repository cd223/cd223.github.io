## Hello, world! 👋

I’m a Senior Engineer based in London with over 7 years’ experience in FinTech and Financial Services. I mainly focus on backend development, having led Product and Platform teams on a range of projects.

On my [Blog](../posts/), I share:  
- Thoughts on backend development & industry trends  
- Shout-outs to content I’m enjoying (reading, watching, listening)  
- War stories and incidents — from projects I’ve worked on or public ones  

I try to keep things short and engaging. If something resonates or you have a different take you think I should consider, I’d love to start a conversation! I don't proclaim to be an expert in what I write about, so I'd love to hear different viewpoints.

The opinions I share on this blog are my own, and not the views of my employer.

## My background 🧑‍💻
- **Languages**: Java, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, SQL.
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Redshift, SQS/SNS), Terraform, Docker. 

In my career I have worked on pricing and order management sytems at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/). I have also launched and supported new SaaS products for Hedge Funds and Banks at [OpenGamma](https://opengamma.com/). In that time, I have been an Engineering Manager and an Individual Contributor. 

This experience means I do have opinions, but they are **loosely held**. The two words I use most are "it depends".
